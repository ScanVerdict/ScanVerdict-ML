Gregory Cowgill,4 stars,2 weeks ago,"Great food, great service, friendly staff. However, please just open at 7 and close at 11 every day, weekends included; there are students who depend on it and shouldn't have to wait to eat if they're particularly busy."
lonelyjoe,5 stars,5 years ago,"The interior is neat and modern.
It is spacious enough for students to have a meal in a non-packed and relaxing environment. The beef&turkey lasagna that I had 2 days ago were much better than the lasagna I ate at a local Olive Garden :)"
Taesung Hwang,4 stars,a month ago,"Large dining hall with numerous food options throughout the day and comfortable, open social atmosphere."
Busta,4 stars,a year ago,"I've been eating here as a student for a lil more than a month now, and I gotta say it aint half bad. It's got a nice variety of foods available everyday to an extent, and whenever I've had a tough workout in the morning, the 'eatery can provide the big d**k breakfast I require. There's been times where the breakfast becomes unavailable before 11am, sooner than expected, so I miss out on some of that french toast or pancakes, but we chillin wit the brunches. Even at its busiest, they bring out the food consistently and hastily with little gaps between when all the foods been taken. I commend the employees on their work ethic. Plus, the yogurt slaps. Seriously, try that yogurt and granola, that s**t is gas."
Elena Melena,4 stars,a year ago,"Sometimes the food is nasty, but the cheeseburgers are absolutely bussin. Almost as good as in n out. No cap. Eggs look fake but are still good. They never have the Mexican drinks even tho the containers are always there. I suspect г@c!sm. The workers are very nice, love them all."
Curtis Masa,3 stars,a year ago,"I ain't finna lie, the food was gas af the first few weeks of the quarter. Now its mid at best most of the time. Burgers, though, are always consistently cooked to perfection."
Vince Lu,5 stars,3 years ago,"The Anteatery is kind of far for me, but the tastes are not doubt."
Emily Faith Cabrera Jackson,1 star,4 years ago,"The food is absolutely horrible. Onions and garlic in everything, almost like they don't know how to season food otherwise. Also between 2-5 nothing is open so you basically can only eat pizza and burgers. I've had that 4 days in a row, because I can't get there earlier. The only positive is that they have a freestyle machine and the sugar cookies are bomb"
Jinsmr 金糖伍,5 stars,a year ago,"This is a dining hall buffet style with a lot of options for each meal time. For example, during dinner there is a salad bar, soups, fresh fruits, many main entrees, pizzas, dessert, and drinks. The food tastes really delicious. Comfortable atmosphere. The staff are extremely kind and funny."
Mario Moreno,5 stars,7 months ago,"Good commissary to chill and grab a bite to eat..lots of variety and the cooks there are on top of things...believe me, i know.."
Chris Gravina,3 stars,3 years ago,"The food quality varies a lot, some days it's good and other days are really bad. Taza, the coffee place right next to it, is a big plus, as they use Pete's coffee beans. Highlights would be the cookies and definitely the Lo Mein noodles. Finally, the staff is really friendly and the background music is good."
Barracuda,4 stars,9 months ago,Pretty good. Pizza could use higher quality ingredients.
Justin Lonh,3 stars,6 years ago,"Food is okay, variety is good. Somewhat expensive for non-first years and non-students. Atmosphere is very nice and modern, variety of different seating options and furniture."
QT Do,3 stars,5 years ago,Food is decent compared to the other dining halls but they serve onions with almost everything.
Shobhit Mendiratta,5 stars,5 months ago,Various choices of food available.
Kevin Li,5 stars,6 years ago,Way better than Lot 5 and Pippin's. It has a good variety of food
Cindy Khuu,5 stars,5 years ago,"Friendly, good food, good place to stay and eat, huge restaurants and a lot of parking"
Elizabeth Solorzano,3 stars,6 years ago,"It's a college a you can eat dining place. The food isn't outstanding, it's okay."
Devon Taylor,3 stars,6 years ago,im really offended that they don't have vegan tacos every taco tuesday
Fred Hernandez,5 stars,8 months ago,Great food for students
