"Joel Miller,2 stars,il y a 5 mois,""I really love habit, but this visit was terrible. The staff are great guys, the taste of the food was excellent! But a soda machine is a horror! All drinks have a disgusting chlorine smell, it's not possible to drink, it's a big problem!""";
"Î™ΩÏÑúÎãà,5 stars,il y a une semaine,""C'√©tait un peu effrayant de voir un adotti sans abri assis sur la terrasse, mais je ne supporte pas Habit Burger. En fait, je pr√©f√®re les frites de haricots aux hamburgers.""";
"Celia Faiola,1 star,il y a 2 jours,""We had a very small order. 2 burgers, French fries, onion rings, and a kids meal. They managed to forget the French fries and onion rings even with this small order. Didn't realize it until we got home (good reminder to always double-check before leaving) but then we couldn't contact any living human at the store to get a refund. You have to fill out an unnecessarily long inquiry form on their website. The whole thing is ridiculous. Good grief.""";
"Nok Ming CHAI,5 stars,il y a 5 jours,""The food was awesome, really like their Santa Barbara Chur Sandwich. The combination of a butter roasted bread, fresh avocado, double patties, lettuce and tomato are so good. One thing I‚Äôd them to improve is the A/C, it‚Äôs always cold‚Ä¶""";
"Paula Adams,4 stars,il y a 3 ans,""A burger place with nice twists. You'll find here some nicw ingredients you don't typically see i mn other fast food: pineapple in a teriyaki burger, sweet potatoes fries, and fruits based ice tea such as peach-ginger. A refreshing change. Pagers are nice so you can go sit outside and know when your food is ready without having to line up, but a number for the table and staff bringing the platter to your table like chick-fil-a would have been better!""";
"Ichi Oka,5 stars,il y a 3 ans,""Les galettes grill√©es au charbon de bois sont d√©licieuses.";
Le burger toast √† l'avocat est √©galement tout √† fait d√©licieux avec beaucoup d'ingr√©dients.;
"L'employ√© du magasin est tr√®s sympathique et c'est un magasin de hamburgers qui est aussi bon qu'√† l'ext√©rieur.""";
Alex Rubio,4 stars,il y a 6 ans,Really good burgers and shakes. However the dining area feels a bit small. The outdoor seating is plentiful but there will be a new restaurant opening next door which may make the space very crowded especially once classes are back in session at UCI;
"Bryan Lau,4 stars,il y a un an,""The Santa Barbara Char is a sandwich that goes beyond burgers.  It's buttery, crunchy, and savory in the best way.  Paired with onion rings and an okay price point, it's hard to go wrong with it.  In-N-Out is a faster and cleaner restaurant, but the Habit's food is much more substantial to me.""";
Catherine English,3 stars,il y a 7 mois,I was with a party of 5. My salad was not right. I had some stomach problems and nausea after eating it. My guess is that the lettuce was not fresh. The taste was a little off. The service was quick. The tables were dirty. I asked for a cloth to clean the table and was told that someone would come clean it when they had time. They never came.;
Aruna K A,4 stars,il y a 4 mois,I really liked the Crispy Chicken burger. The service was good and fast. Great value for money.;
"Cristian,5 stars,il y a un an,""Didn't know what to expect from this place, as it is my first visit to a Habit Grill restaurant. The quality of the food and drink offered at this establishment made sure it was a positive experience. The burger was delicious (the Santa Barbara Club). The sweet potato fries and mango limeade was an excellent topper for the meal. The burger was so moist and tender, so I really liked that. The staff was courteous and quick, they work exceptionally. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who asked about good places to eat.""";
Daniel Kahl,5 stars,il y a 3 mois,I think it is the best burger spot around UCI. Get the onion rings too. Nice employees.;
Jon Clay,5 stars,il y a 5 mois,The chicken club here is one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. It's delectable. Highly recommend;
"Aaron Baldwin,3 stars,il y a 5 mois,""Ordering from a screen with no human interaction is dumb, and the employees are definitely embracing it. If you want your first taste of a human-less interaction I'd say check it out.""";
"Salty Sauce,1 star,il y a 3 ans,""I'm not sure why the cashier was so intent on giving the customer who was picking up their food before me some condiments but it seemed odd and out of place. And she asked that customer multiple times, almost forcing them. So when I got my to go order, I was a little curious as to why she didn't even ask me once. I had to ask her. Still not a big deal but when I got my fries and burger, the 15 dollar order needed to be covered in sauce because it was horrible. Dry, cold, and stale fries. Soggy but still somehow a stale tasting bun. Really unacceptable for a high end costing burger. How can I get a refund on a burger because I wanted to throw it out but I was already far away and not worth driving back for it. Ugh. So disappointed. Plus the odd behavior from the start just added to the poor experience.";
;
"Update : response from the moderator....asking for details of the location??? This IS the location. I'm GIVING details. What more do you want?? If that isn't a computer generated response, I don't know what is. Lame. I think I'll go to other burger places that can make food correctly and not charge so much. Thanks.""";
"David Tiemeier,2 stars,il y a 5 mois,""The pub burger bun seemed dried out or overcooked/reheated as if it had been sitting.  And, the onion rings were burnt.""";
Pooya Khosravi,5 stars,il y a 7 mois,Amazing staff and service. The burgers are delicious and they have great icecream options. The icecream cone is an item I always get when I go to habit.;
"Yoonji Kim,1 star,il y a 2 ans,""READ THIS IF YOU DON‚ÄôT WANT TO EAT A COLD SOGGY BURGER.";
;
I went to pick up my order and the staff handed me a bag behind the counter. After I got home I found out they forgot to give me my coke so I had to drive all way back. When I got there, the staff told me the coke was on the side table. Why couldn‚Äôt she tell me in the first place? Now I‚Äôm back home with my cold soggy burger and watery coke for dinner.;
;
"I want the Habit staff to make sure their customers get what they paid for BEFORE they leave the store.""";
"Daniel Palomera,3 stars,il y a un an,""To describe the Habit in terms of quality, it is definitely one of the best in my opinion - however that's not why I gave it 3 stars. The reason why is because of the curbside customer service at this location. To explain, I ordered curbside to be around 11:00am on Friday and had some of the items such as french fries to be extra crispy and my charburger to be well done. I gave it time so that it would be perfected and for the most part was well made. Now when it came to the drink, I ordered it without Ice - the lady who came out with my order told me that she couldn't because she was busy at the moment, but I told her it's within the order. She left after I got the order, and by the end of it I was thinking, it only takes a few seconds to refill without ice. That was basically the experience I had at the curbside at this location.""";
"Zihe Yao,1 star,il y a un an,""Don‚Äôt order the shakes, they don‚Äôt give you shakes and no money refund.""";
"Deimos Somied.,5 stars,il y a 7 mois,""When I visit my brother, this is my favorite place to go. His GF is vegan so, I assume they have a decent vegan option. My favorite is the AHI burger.""";
"Ashley Jauregui,3 stars,il y a 2 ans,""My coworkers and I place a large order consisting of a family pack, a kids meal, and specialty burger and and Cobb salad. This place fulfilled all the orders correctly except my salad. Instead of giving a Cobb salad, they gave us a regular garden salad. I had never been so disappointed in a food order as I was looking forward to that salad. I paid for a $9-$10 salad and got a salad worth $5. I honestly don't want my money back, I just really wanted that salad. My biggest disappointment today. üò≠""";

"UPDATE: The automated reply from the ‚Äòowner‚Äô gives you a link that promises vouches for a discount that I have not received. Double checked my e-mail and junk mail! Ridiculous""";
"Sara Hummel,5 stars,il y a 2 ans,""Personally I like Habit better than In n Out. If you completely disagree then you might just want to stop reading here. Otherwise, continue on... this is a great habit location. Always clean and the staff is really helpful and corteous. Two big thumbs up for this Habit location and I've tried a lot of them!""";
"Chad Zdenek,1 star,il y a 2 ans,""I'll start off by saying I'm a huge Habit fan and eat there all the time.  However, this was my first time to this location. I'm not sure if it's always like this but the experience was terrible. It was a $100 order and six orders of fries were over cooked but cold. I'm not sure how they managed that. Three sandwiches were missing the cheese we paid extra for, the pineapple was missing from one, and the grilled sourdough was hard as a rock. The only saving grace was there were outdoor heatlamps that we used to reheat the fries. We won't be heading to this location again...""";
"Paul H,5 stars,il y a un an,""We enjoyed our visit to this particular location. Love all the indoor potted plants and the food no matter what location it's always well done, so delicious!ü§§üòäüëçüèº""";
"Amber Bradley,4 stars,il y a 5 ans,""This Habit gets crowded during lunch hours Monday through Friday. I usually arrive around 11:30am so I can get a table. It's really popular with both college students and office employees who work close by. The employees working here are always nice. The food is good, cheap, and comes out quickly. I usually order a kids grilled cheese with fries because it's about $5 and you get a good portion of food. I'll sometimes order the tempura green beans, which I actually prefer over their french fries. I always order my fries well done, however, it's a 50/50 chance if they will be well done or not. This is one of my favorite places to eat lunch at. I wish they were slightly bigger and had more seating so I wouldn't have to come early every time.""";
Lucas Jaggernauth (Luke),5 stars,il y a 5 mois,Good burger outlet with visually stunning presentation.;
"R22,5 stars,il y a 11 mois,""HOW CAN A PLACE BE SO GOOD, my favorite burger place as a vegetarian. They have so many vegetarian options and as a irvine local ive been going there for so long and the fries are so flavourfilled""";

;
"Update: currently here, decided to order an ice cream cone also.   After I ordered I asked when I can get the cone.   She replied, """"I will get it for you"""".   3 groups immediately came inside so I had to go outside since no one was getting our drinks or cone.   When I returned inside to get food, still no cone.   Will be a while before I return here.";
Update.  Been here about 7 or 8 times since last review.   The chicken patty has been good since original review.  Note:  indoor temp is 63F, everyone is eating outside where it is 68F;
;
"Usually very good, but today my chicken sandwich was at the thickest only 1/8"""" thick, way overcooked, and only covered half my bun.   A disgrace to serve a customer.  Worst chicken, the cheap pressed chicken from Carl's or Jack was of higher quality.""";
"Mike,1 star,il y a 2 ans,""Not thrilled.";
;
I added avocado to the burger but when I got home, no avocado.  I called the location, they said I had to email the corporate.  Emailed the corporate, 16 days later got a reply that they can send me some coupons, if I give them my home address.;
;
Home address, really?  You cannot email the coupon?  You can not credit the charge?  Nevermind...;
;
"Inspect your burgers before you walked out!""";
"Scotty The Ghost,2 stars,il y a 4 ans,""I ordered a bacon BBQ """"char""""burger with cheese added. The cheese was barely melted, the barbecue sauce was lacking, and I could barely get the taste of the bacon. Their fries were good, at the very least. Still, I'd recommend visiting the nearby In N' Out, if you're craving a good fast food burger.""";
Tiffany T,4 stars,il y a 6 ans,The burgers here are fantastic like every other Habit.  However this location is small with limited indoor and outdoor seating.   The register is very close to the door so it always appear to have a long line when actually the line might have 5 or 6 people.   However I love that there is one so close to campus.;
Ben M,5 stars,il y a 6 ans,Great service and good food. A charbroiled burger made your way from super fresh ingredients. The tri-tip sandwich is also quite tasty. The Habit gets its flavor from the flame broiled cooking method and super fresh ingredients. This location is new to the Campus Plaza shopping center and it is a welcome addition. Happy dining.;
Sergio Preciado Jr,1 star,il y a un an,Im dressed up as Santa and they are so aggressive 1st they did not let me washed my hands and the food we ask 3 times one burger with no cheese and yes onions but they did not do the order right they are mad.... With me of them not listening .... Yep bad experience...;
"susan hhan,1 star,il y a 2 ans,""For some reason  the girl preparing vege burger kept that burger seating in front of her instead putting in container, the manager looking person had to go back and check and she just started at it then finally went into bag.  It had smell that was foul then it went away, I was almost going to ask to prepare new one?";" then again I did not eat it after second bite.   Somehow these habit  cookers are sabotaging my food and ones at von karmon  even followed me outside not just ince three times checking while I sat in car, bring in it trash that had hardly nothing in it, just eyeing on me.   These inbisols are evil must be troubled souls, just for few bucks or afraid of something from nazis and does anything they ask to do."""

"Winnie Iko,5 stars,il y a 3 ans,""Edit: 4.5* Came back and the SB has avacado again. Tastes great, although the sourdough is a bit too crispy so it scratches the hard palate.";
;
"Staff is great. However, the menu is not accurate. Santa Barbara Char is listed to include avacado (which is over $1 menu add on), yet when I ordered both times (on different months, and in a different location), they did not come with avacado and I was charged full price. Update your menu if the SB Char no longer contains avacado, or if you run out of avacado, subtract the price of avacado add-on.""";
