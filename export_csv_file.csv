0,Nonamed Unamed,1,12,"This school is full of people who have failed their preparation. I advise you to first do a public preparation, rather than pay.

The dropout rate is very high (and chess profiles are quite often passionate people). At this price, I advise you to take several private teachers, and in a real preparation",en,NEUTRAL,0.45485323667526245,['price'],['Negative'],[0.9521]
