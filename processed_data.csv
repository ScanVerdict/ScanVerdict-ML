Hugo,1,a year ago,"Good morning,

I visited your bakery this morning, and I was extremely disappointed by the deplorable and disrespectful welcome I received. The saleswoman with glasses was unpleasant, condescending, almost vulgar, and allowed herself to make completely inappropriate remarks with customers. I really hated my visit to your house today.

I had already visited your establishment several times this summer, and I always had the pleasure of being taken care of by a nice young dark-haired lady, who no longer seems to work for you, which is a shame, because her service was more than excellent: smile, kindness and kindness were constantly present.

I am therefore very disappointed to find that the service has deteriorated to this point. This does not seem to be a commercial approach that represents your brand as I knew it: know that you have lost a customer and that I will not come back to your bakery, even if it means traveling several kilometers to buy what I need. elsewhere.

A word of advice: change staff and choose people who know about customer service!!

Criss LoneKey,2,a year ago,"There from the very beginning, I could notice the decline in the service of the saleswomen and I agree with most of the negative opinions concerning them. I don't know the turnover/total workforce but one thing is sure, it's that smiles are rare, the answers are quite curt and the welcome is often cold.
Literally 2 steps from my house, I have already retracted myself at the last moment just thinking about it.
Regarding the products, I take a traditional baguette from time to time, which I find very good. For the pastries, it's a bit lucky, I have the impression that sometimes it passes and other times less (maybe leftovers from the day before).
